Freetime Dead project 

My first freetime big project started in 1990 and dead in 1995 (more or less). 
A Z80 based single board computer moved to HD64180 with a Motorola MC6845 video controller.
An Hardware project with eprom programmer. Fully developed in C and zilog assembler.

The repository contains a subset of the original source code only as memorabilia :)
